**Introduction**
This report explores the relationship between trader performance and overall market sentiment in the Bitcoin ecosystem. The objective is to identify behavioral patterns, analyze correlations, and draw insights that can support smarter trading strategies in volatile market conditions.

**Key Insights**

Traders tend to open larger positions during market “Greed” phases, showing higher confidence and risk appetite.

PnL volatility increases during “Fear” periods due to abrupt sell-offs and cautious buy-ins.

Transaction fees scale linearly with trade size — a critical factor for optimizing trading strategies.

**Conclusion**

This analysis highlights that trader behavior is closely tied to market sentiment. During Greed phases, traders exhibit more aggressive strategies, while Fear periods lead to reduced exposure and smaller trades.

The combined dataset approach bridges the emotional and transactional aspects of trading, providing valuable input for designing AI-driven behavioral trading models or risk-aware trading dashboards in the Web3 environment.
